This is a back end part of my project for CodeAcademy. Here I've used Laravel to make an API that is used in the front end.    

To launch this project you need PHP 8.0.2, Laravel 8 and Docker. 
Delete '.example' extension from 'env.example' file then use the following commands in order:
1. composer install
2. wsl
3. ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
4. ./vendor/bin/sail bash
5. php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
